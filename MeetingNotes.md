# April 16, 2012 (public) #

  * Attendence: Alan Leung, Nick Santos, John Lenz, ChadKillingsworth.
  * Release?
  * Problem with sorting dependency in some projects. We need to put that in the release note.
  * JQuery status, ready to do, unit tests passed, getting the JQuery specific stuff in
  * How are Googlers going to use it? Check with the chain coding convention
  * Status on moving to Git? Not right, may be we should set up an official Mirror.
  * ([Issue 708](https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/issues/detail?id=708)) Question about what we are inferring or what we are not inferring in an anonymous function
  * Nick working with type inference dealing with inner function.



# April 2, 2012 (public) #

  * Attendence: Alan, Nick, John, ChadKillingsworth.
  * The @expose feature is working properly, we should announce it next release.
  * Chad: New YouTube API extern missing methods. Chad is working on it.
  * John: Side Effect propagation problem (issue:687)
  * Nick: Type checking bug fixes
  * John: Google specific things. Deleting properties cause performance issues in V8?
  * Alan: Get message fallback


# Feb 21, 2012 (public) #
  * Attendance: Alan, Nick, John, ChadKillingsworth.
  * Release after SourceFile Change.
  * Chad' been busy.
  * What to call the new exporting function?  @expose Nick is interested in implementing it / writing a design doc for it.
  * Nick, white listing work.
  * John, GWT profiling information
  * Chad, student found a spelling error in Closure Library, side effect status.
  * 

# Feb 21, 2012 (public) #
  * Attendance: Alan
  * Alan: How to speed up compilation speed..
  * Nick: i18n story for closure? Think about it.


# Jan 23, 2012 (public) #
  * Attendance: Alan, Nick, John, Andre, Chad
  * Nick: would like to start working on a more library-like compilation model. For example, you type-check closure library, and then the compiler spits out externs, and then you compile your application code against closure-library externs. So you wouldn't need to re-type-check closure-library when your application code changes.
  * John: Do you allow different options for optimizations vs. type-checking?
  * Chad: This doesn't really solve the general problem of auto-generating externs.  What's the exact use case?
  * Alan: How do you handle version mismatches?
  * Needs a formal proposal

  * Nick: Auto-sorting by dependency information?
  * John: Do you provide validation of dependency info? (if you require something, it must be provided?) we do this for closure library, should we do it for others?

  * Chad: working on jquery optimizations. Introducing an "expandedEach" (which the developer knows is explicitly expanded at compile time) has made the code a lot simpler. There are currently two main problems:
  * We can't export properties in a way such that setting the property  from external code will work
  * Reference to 'this' seem to break.
  * Discussion about:
  * It's impossible for the compiler to know what "this" refers to, because it changes at runtime.
  * Should there be a "conservative" collapsing mode?
  * Are there ways we can export a property in a way that will work for property assignments?

  * Andre: The internationalization story is badly documented.
  * Nick: What i18n do you need?
  * Andre: XTBs would work
  * Nick: There are a bunch of "completed" plugins in the wild, but we've never been sure about which one should be the "official" plugin, or the "official" build process
  * John: Does Plovr solve this problem? If not, could we get Plovr to solve the build-process issues?
  * Action Item: talk on the mailing list about what the official solution should be.
